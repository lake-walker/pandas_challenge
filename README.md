# Heros of Pymoli
  The first of two assignments to organize data and produce several different analyses.
  The csv file contained purchase data from different users. The data contains the users username, purchase ID, gender, price, item purchsed.
  First was to determine the total number of unique players that made purchases. 
  Purchasing Analysis: a analysis that found the number of unique items, average total price, total number of purchases, and total revenue 
  Gender Demographics: a analysis of the different genders. Produced these results based on gender: Percentage and count of males, females, and other/non-disclosed
  Purchasing Analysis (gender): this analysis looks at the different purchasing patterns of the genders. A breakdown of the number of items purchased, average purchase price,    total purchase value, and average purchase total per person. All by gender
  Age demographics: like the gender demographics analysis but for age
  Top Spenders: an analysis of the top spending users based on total spent in dollars
  Most Popular Item: found the top 5 items according to purchase volume
  Most Profitable Item: found the top 5 items based on total purchase price
  
 # PyCitySchools
  The second assignment analyzes high schools in a given state
  The main objective is to compare the different schools based off test scores around math and reading
  The following analysis were done:
  Snapshot of the districts key metrics:
    * Total Schools
    * Total Students
    * Total Budget
    * Average Math Score
    * Average Reading Score
    * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
    * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
    * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
   Create a school summary based off the following values:
    * School Name
    * School Type
    * Total Students
    * Total School Budget
    * Per Student Budget
    * Average Math Score
    * Average Reading Score
    * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
    * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
    * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)
   Find the top performing and bottom performing school based off overall passing %
   Using the above data frames I create an analysis by grade (9-12)
   The final comparisons breaksdown the schools by spending, size, and type
